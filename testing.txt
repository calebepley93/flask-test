GOAL

Test plays from the bot with the goal of determining whether or not system is working as expected.

## EXPECTATIONS

* 3%+ ROI on 5000 plays
* consistent CLV (majority of plays, should probably shoot for 75%+)

## TESTING strategy

* Tracking plays
- could use pickit for vast majority, but missing bovada/bol
- could use excel for all, but would be a pain
- could use pickit for most, and then manually track bovada/bol
- could use pickit for most, and then manually track bovada/bol, and then manually track CLV in excel

## TRACKING CLV

- Need to make a checkpoint for when I take a play. 
- Can do it manually to start with in the EV tracker spreadsheet
- Ideal is to have a script that do it for me from discord message
- Script will need to read start dates from EV tracker and then 
    * query CNO game odds -> market -> play FV about 10 mins before game
    * write into CLV column in EV tracker spreadsheet

## Chatgpt suggestions

- Use a flask web application as intermediary between discord link and excel file
- "app doesn't need to be complex, just a single route will suffice"
- secure, unique link is generated when play is identified
