EV Bots are (mostly) done, now just need a script that grabs CLV and a way to autoinsert plays into the spreadsheet

1. Target is going to be game odds page: https://www.crazyninjaodds.com/site/browse/games.aspx
2. Other source of truth is the spreadsheet desktop/WORK/betting/evTracker.xlsx
3. Will need to grab the start date in scripts and append it to spreadsheet
4. Will need a check for the start date and the current time
5. If current time is 10-15 minutes before game start, will need to navigate to game odds page -> event link -> market input -> FV line for bet 
6. Will need to grab the line value and append it to the spreedsheet in the relevant cell

HOW TO GET IT done

1. Will need to use the selenium package to navigate to the game odds page
2. Will need to use pandas to read the spreadsheet and append the line value to the relevant cell
3. Will need to use the datetime package to check the current time and compare it to the start time of the game
4. Will need to use the time package to sleep the script until the game start time is 10-15 minutes away

NEXT STEPS

1. Manually track plays and CLV in spreadsheet until CLV bot is done, can begin testing today
2. Finish CLV bot to automate CLV capture process
3. Make a link from discord that lets me track auto insert plays into spreadsheet
